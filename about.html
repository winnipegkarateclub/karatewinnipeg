<p><em>Sensei Loreth</em> is presently involved in administering the provincial and national organization of ISKF Canada. He is President of ISKF Canada and the Chief Instructor of ISKF Manitoba and sits as a technical committee member of the international organization.</p>



<p><em>Shotokan Winnipeg</em> involves family participation (parents and their children train together in the same class) On Tuesday and Thursday, classes take place at Parc LaSalle School in St. Norbert. The first class (6:00 p.m.) is for children 6-11 years of age and their parents, as well as individuals 12 years of age and over who have just started training. Basically, White to Green belts train in the 6:00 p.m. class. New students recieve private instruction for the first month or until they are comfortable with regular class participation. The 2nd class (6:45 p.m.) is an Intermediate class for Purple and Brown belt level. Black belts train from 7:30 - 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursday. Classes on Sunday morning accomadate all levels.</p>

<p>Although one of the most senior karate instructors in Canada, Sensei Loreth has kept the cost of instruction down to accommodate family participation. The style of karate that Sensei Loreth teaches (Shotokan) focuses on perfection of character, self-defence, sport and fitness. Respect for others is a very important element in his classes.</p>

<h2 id="whatkarate">What is Karate?</h2>

<div class="picture yaguchi1" style="width:596px;"> <img src="images/Yaguchi_Bruce.jpg" width="594" height="492" alt="Yaguchi pose" /> <h3>Demonstration by Shihan Yutaka Yaguchi </h3></div>

<div class="quotestyle_right">
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;One of the most striking features of karate is that it may be engaged in by anybody, young or old, strong or weak, male or female.&#8221; <br /> <div class="quoter_right">Master Gichin Funakoshi</div></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Karate is many things. It is an excellent and well-balanced form of exercise. It is a highly evolved Asian means of self-defense. There are many different styles of karate just like there are many different languages in the world. But, as all language seeks to communicate, so all karate seeks to enhance self-defense. Karate is an art since the karateka must reach beyond just the mechanics of technique toward creativity in the application of karate skills in order to be proficient. It is also an art in the sense that karate represents a body of accumulated skills gained through considerable experience. It is a well organized, highly-competitive sport. Karate can also be a way of life. Most importantly, karate is a means of personal character development and improvement.</p> 

<p>There is karate and there is Karate-do. Karate is a general name for a type of Okinawan and Japanese martial art using only empty hands. In the past, karate was written using the characters for "empty hand" a purely physical way to describe karate. Yet, there is a deeper aspect to serious karate training which deals with character development. </p> 

<div class="picture funakoshi" style="width:170px;"> <img src="images/funakoshi.jpg" width="168" height="252" alt="master funakoshi" /> <h3>Master Gichen Funakoshi </h3>  <em>the founder of Shotokan Karate</em></div>



<p><em>Master Funakoshi</em>, the founder of our style of karate, modified the way karate was written by changing the character used for "kara" from empty in a physical sense to empty in a spiritual sense. In the former context, "kara" conveyed only a physical aspect of karate which was just concerned with technique. However, Master Funakoshi recognized that there is also a more profound dimension of the "empty hand" martial art which is concerned with psychological development and is often referred to as development of the spirit. This is Karate-do. </p> 


<div class="quotestyle_left">
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Students of any art, clearly including Karate-do, must never forget the cultivation of the mind and the body.&#8221; <br /> <div class="quoter_right">Master Gichin Funakoshi</div></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Karate is not a religion or a philosophy, but it may complement religion and philosophy in one's life. Karate is not merely a sport or form of exercise although it does incorporate these elements. Karate is not merely a form of moving Zen or active meditation although karate also contains these benefits.</p>
<p>Karate is a way for an individual to realize greater potential and expand the limits of that individual's physical and mental capabilities. Karate is an excellent, time-proven method of personal development. </p>
<p>According to the International Shotokan Karate Federation, karate is not a martial art whose ultimate aim is to win. It is based on hard physical training that demands strict mental discipline by which one attempts to mold an ideal character through physical and spiritual trials.</p>


<p>As Master Funakoshi stated: "True Karate-do is this; that in daily life, one's mind and body be trained and developed in a spirit of humility; and that in critical times, one can be devoted utterly to the cause of justice." </p>
